abstract = {For years the PC community has struggled to provide secure solutions on open platforms. Intel has developed innovative new technology to enable SW developers to develop and deploy secure applications on open platforms. The technology enables applications to execute with confidentiality and integrity in the native OS environment. It does this by providing ISA extensions for generating hardware enforceable containers at a granularity determined by the developer. These containers while opaque to the operating system are managed by the OS. This paper analyzes the threats and attacks to applications. It then describes the ISA extension for generating a HW based container. Finally it describes the programming model of this container.},

abstract = {Sancus security architecture for networked embedded devices was proposed in 2013 at the USENIX Security conference. It supports remote (even third-party) sooware installation on devices while maintaining strong security guarantees. More speciically, Sancus can remotely aaest to a sooware provider that a speciic sooware module is running uncompromised, and can provide a secure communication channel between sooware modules and sooware providers. Sooware modules can securely maintain local state, and can securely interact with other sooware modules that they choose to trust. Over the past three years, signiicant experience has been gained with applications of Sancus, and several extensions of the architecture have been investigated-both by the original designers as well as by independent researchers. Informed by these additional research results, this journal version of the Sancus paper describes an improved design and implementation, supporting additional security guarantees (such as conndential deployment) and a more eecient cryptographic core. We describe the design of Sancus 2.0 (without relying on any prior knowledge of Sancus), and develop and evaluate a prototype FPGA implementation. .e prototype extends an MSP430 processor with hardware support for the memory access control and cryptographic functionality required to run Sancus. We report on our experience with using Sancus in a variety of application scenarios, and discuss some important avenues of ongoing and future work.},

abstract = {A fully abstract compiler prevents security features of the source language from being bypassed by an attacker operating at the target language level. Unfortunately, developing fully abstract compilers is very complex, and it is even more so when the target language is an untyped assembly language. To provide a fully abstract compiler that targets untyped assembly, it has been suggested to extend the target language with a protected module architecture—an assembly-level isolation mechanism which can be found in next-generation processors. This article provides a fully abstract compilation scheme whose source language is an object-oriented, high-level language and whose target language is such an extended assembly language. The source language enjoys features such as dynamic memory allocation and exceptions. Secure compilation of first-order method references, cross-package inheritance, and inner classes is also presented. Moreover, this article contains the formal proof of full abstraction of the compilation scheme. Measurements of the overhead introduced by the compilation scheme indicate that it is negligible.},

@article{Avatefipour2017,
abstract = {-Nowadays with the help of advanced technology, modern vehicles are not only made up of mechanical devices but also consist of highly complex electronic devices and connections to the outside world. There are around 70 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in modern vehicle which are communicating with each other over the standard communication protocol known as Controller Area Network (CAN-Bus) that provides the communication rate up to 1Mbps. There are different types of in-vehicle network protocol and bus system namely Controlled Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnected Network (LIN), Media Oriented System Transport (MOST), and FlexRay. Even though CAN-Bus is considered as de-facto standard for in-vehicle network communication, it inherently lacks the fundamental security features by design like message authentication. This security limitation has paved the way for adversaries to penetrate into the vehicle network and do malicious activities which can pose a dangerous situation for both driver and passengers. In particular, nowadays vehicular networks are not only closed systems, but also they are open to different external interfaces namely Bluetooth, GPS, to the outside world. Therefore, it creates new opportunities for attackers to remotely take full control of the vehicle. The objective of this research is to survey the current limitations of CAN-Bus protocol in terms of secure communication and different solutions that researchers in the society of automotive have provided to overcome the CAN-Bus limitation on different layers.},

abstract = {The design of in-vehicle communication networks has been always concerned with reliability and safety. There was no much attention paid to the security of such networks. This is because there was no clear evidence if the security of such networks could be compromised. However, recent ex- periments have shown the consequences of compromising in- vehicle networks. Those experiments relied on vulnerabilities that exist in such networks. Some of those vulnerabilities arise from the used communication standards themselves. Therefore, it became necessary to find ways of introducing security to the used standards. In this paper, a lightweight message source authentication protocol for Controller Area Network (CAN) is proposed and fully implemented. The main advantage of the protocol is that it can be practically deployed in vehicles manufactured nowadays with minimum overhead. The protocol does not require any hardware modifications to be done in the CAN network. Also, it does not add much overhead to the embedded software of the ECUs. Moreover, it tends to avoid any modifications from being done to the existing CAN message sets that are being exchanged between ECUs.},

Ensuring security in both wired and mobile applications has become imperative. Making an embedded product safe from malicious attacks has consequences for hardware and software design, as well as the physical attributes of the design. It is now accepted that the best protected embedded systems must have security measures designed-in from the outset, starting with the specification for the processor or CPU core. ARM is enabling system security by integrating protective measures into the heart of its cores and providing secure software to complement the efforts of semiconductor manufacturers, product OEMs and operating system partners. For OEM partners, the issue of platform integrity has become paramount. For network operators and content providers, concerns over digital rights management (DRM) and m-commerce are growing.},

This paper proposes LeiA, a lightweight authentication protocol for the Controller Area Network (CAN). This protocol allows critical vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to authenticate each other providing compartmentalisation and preventing a number of attacks e.g., where a compromised CD player is able to accelerate the vehicle. LeiA is designed to run under the stringent time and bandwidth constraints of automotive applications and is backwards compatible with existing vehicle infrastructure. The protocol is suitable to be implemented using lightweight cryptographic primitives yet providing appropriate security levels by limiting the usage of every key in the system. The security of LeiA is proven under the unforgeability assumption of the MAC scheme under chosen message attacks (uf-cma).},

abstract = {The IT security of automotive systems is an evolving area of research. To analyse the current situation and the potentially growing tendency of arising threats we performed several practical tests on recent automotive technology. With a focus on automotive systems based on CAN bus technology, this article summarises the results of four selected tests performed on the control systems for the window lift, warning light and airbag control system as well as the central gateway. These results are supplemented in this article by a classification of these four attack scenarios using the established CERT taxonomy and an analysis of underlying security vulnerabilities, and especially, potential safety implications. With respect to the results of these tests, in this article we further discuss two selected countermeasures to address basic weaknesses exploited in our tests. These are adaptations of intrusion detection (discussing three exemplary detection patterns) and IT-forensic measures (proposing proactive measures based on a forensic model). This article discusses both looking at the four attack scenarios introduced before, covering their capabilities and restrictions. While these reactive approaches are short-term measures, which could already be added to today's automotive IT architecture, long-term concepts also are shortly introduced, which are mainly preventive but will require a major redesign. Beneath a short overview on respective research approaches, we discuss their individual requirements, potential and restrictions.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a series of four industrial case studies in software verification. We applied VeriFast, a sound and modular software verifier based on separation logic, to two Java Card smart card applets, a Linux device driver, and an embedded Linux network management component, the latter two written in C. Our case studies have been carefully selected so as to evaluate the industrial applicability of VeriFast. We focus on proving the absence of safety violations, e.g., that the programs do not perform illegal operations such as dividing by zero or illegal memory accesses. Yet, given the sensitive application environment of our case studies, these safety properties typically have security implications. In this article we give a detailed description of the VeriFast approach to software verification based on two of the above case studies, one in Java and one in C. Finally, we draw conclusions on the overall feasibility of using VeriFast to verify software components in industrial domains that have stringent requirements on reliability and security. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years, several attacks have impressively demon-strated that the software running on embedded controllers in cars can be successfully exploited – often even remotely. The fact that compo-nents that were hitherto purely mechanical, such as connections to the brakes, throttle, and steering wheel, have been computerized makes digi-tal exploits life-threatening. Because of the interconnectedness of sensors, controllers and actuators, any compromised controller can impersonate any other controller by mimicking its control messages, thus effectively depriving the driver of his control. The fact that carmakers develop vehicles in evolutionary steps rather than as revolution, has led us to propose a backward-compatible authen-tication mechanism for the widely used CAN vehicle communication bus. vatiCAN allows recipients of a message to verify its authenticity via HMACs, while not changing CAN messages for legacy, non-critical com-ponents. In addition, vatiCAN detects and prevents attempts to spoof identifiers of critical components. We implemented a vatiCAN prototype and show that it incurs a CAN message latency of less than 4 ms, while giving strong guarantees against non-authentic messages.},

@article{Herrewege2011,
abstract = {The Controller-Area Network (CAN) bus protocol is a bus protocol invented in 1986 by Robert Bosch GmbH, originally intended for automotive use. By now, the bus can be found in devices ranging from cars and trucks, over lightning setups to industrial looms. Due to its nature, it is a system very much fo- cused on safety, i.e., reliability. Unfortunately, there is no build-in way to enforce security, such as encryption or authentication. In this paper, we investigate the problems associated with implementing a backward compatible message authentication protocol on the CAN bus. We show which constraints such a protocol has to meet and why this eliminates, to the best of our knowledge, all the authentication protocols published so far. Furthermore, we present a message authentication protocol, CANAuth, that meets all of the requirements set forth and does not violate any constraint of theCAN bus.},

abstract = {Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model requiring prior physical access has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.},

abstract = {-Nowadays with the help of advanced technology, modern vehicles are not only made up of mechanical devices but also consist of highly complex electronic devices and connections to the outside world. There are around 70 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in modern vehicle which are communicating with each other over the standard communication protocol known as Controller Area Network (CAN-Bus) that provides the communication rate up to 1Mbps. There are different types of in-vehicle network protocol and bus system namely Controlled Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnected Network (LIN), Media Oriented System Transport (MOST), and FlexRay. Even though CAN-Bus is considered as de-facto standard for in-vehicle network communication, it inherently lacks the fundamental security features by design like message authentication. This security limitation has paved the way for adversaries to penetrate into the vehicle network and do malicious activities which can pose a dangerous situation for both driver and passengers. In particular, nowadays vehicular networks are not only closed systems, but also they are open to different external interfaces namely Bluetooth, GPS, to the outside world. Therefore, it creates new opportunities for attackers to remotely take full control of the vehicle. The objective of this research is to survey the current limitations of CAN-Bus protocol in terms of secure communication and different solutions that researchers in the society of automotive have provided to overcome the CAN-Bus limitation on different layers.},

abstract = {Recent research into automotive security has shown that once a single vehicle component is compromised, it is often possible to take full control of the vehicle. This paper proposes LeiA, a lightweight authentication protocol for the Controller Area Network (CAN). This protocol allows critical vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to authenticate each other providing compartmentalisation and preventing a number of attacks e.g., where a compromised CD player is able to accelerate the vehicle. LeiA is designed to run under the stringent time and bandwidth constraints of automotive applications and is backwards compatible with existing vehicle infrastructure. The protocol is suitable to be implemented using lightweight cryptographic primitives yet providing appropriate security levels by limiting the usage of every key in the system. The security of LeiA is proven under the unforgeability assumption of the MAC scheme under chosen message attacks (uf-cma).},

@article{Hoppe2011,
abstract = {The IT security of automotive systems is an evolving area of research. To analyse the current situation and the potentially growing tendency of arising threats we performed several practical tests on recent automotive technology. With a focus on automotive systems based on CAN bus technology, this article summarises the results of four selected tests performed on the control systems for the window lift, warning light and airbag control system as well as the central gateway. These results are supplemented in this article by a classification of these four attack scenarios using the established CERT taxonomy and an analysis of underlying security vulnerabilities, and especially, potential safety implications. With respect to the results of these tests, in this article we further discuss two selected countermeasures to address basic weaknesses exploited in our tests. These are adaptations of intrusion detection (discussing three exemplary detection patterns) and IT-forensic measures (proposing proactive measures based on a forensic model). This article discusses both looking at the four attack scenarios introduced before, covering their capabilities and restrictions. While these reactive approaches are short-term measures, which could already be added to today's automotive IT architecture, long-term concepts also are shortly introduced, which are mainly preventive but will require a major redesign. Beneath a short overview on respective research approaches, we discuss their individual requirements, potential and restrictions.},

abstract = {Sancus security architecture for networked embedded devices was proposed in 2013 at the USENIX Security conference. It supports remote (even third-party) sooware installation on devices while maintaining strong security guarantees. More speciically, Sancus can remotely aaest to a sooware provider that a speciic sooware module is running uncompromised, and can provide a secure communication channel between sooware modules and sooware providers. Sooware modules can securely maintain local state, and can securely interact with other sooware modules that they choose to trust. Over the past three years, signiicant experience has been gained with applications of Sancus, and several extensions of the architecture have been investigated-both by the original designers as well as by independent researchers. Informed by these additional research results, this journal version of the Sancus paper describes an improved design and implementation, supporting additional security guarantees (such as conndential deployment) and a more eecient cryptographic core. We describe the design of Sancus 2.0 (without relying on any prior knowledge of Sancus), and develop and evaluate a prototype FPGA implementation. .e prototype extends an MSP430 processor with hardware support for the memory access control and cryptographic functionality required to run Sancus. We report on our experience with using Sancus in a variety of application scenarios, and discuss some important avenues of ongoing and future work.},

abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) has recently become an important research topic because it integrates various sensors and objects to communicate directly with one another without human intervention. The requirements for the large-scale deployment of the IoT are rapidly increasing with a major security concern. This study focuses on the state-of-the-art IoT security threats and vulnerabilities by conducting an extensive survey of existing works in the area of IoT security. The taxonomy of the current security threats in the contexts of application, architecture, and communication is presented. This study also compares possible security threats in the IoT. We discuss the IoT security scenario and provide an analysis of the possible attacks. Open research issues and security implementation challenges in IoT security are described as well. This study aims to serve as a useful manual of existing security threats and vulnerabilities of the IoT heterogeneous environment and proposes possible solutions for improving the IoT security architecture.},

@inproceedings{Nurnberger2016,
abstract = {In recent years, several attacks have impressively demon-strated that the software running on embedded controllers in cars can be successfully exploited – often even remotely. The fact that compo-nents that were hitherto purely mechanical, such as connections to the brakes, throttle, and steering wheel, have been computerized makes digi-tal exploits life-threatening. Because of the interconnectedness of sensors, controllers and actuators, any compromised controller can impersonate any other controller by mimicking its control messages, thus effectively depriving the driver of his control. The fact that carmakers develop vehicles in evolutionary steps rather than as revolution, has led us to propose a backward-compatible authen-tication mechanism for the widely used CAN vehicle communication bus. vatiCAN allows recipients of a message to verify its authenticity via HMACs, while not changing CAN messages for legacy, non-critical com-ponents. In addition, vatiCAN detects and prevents attempts to spoof identifiers of critical components. We implemented a vatiCAN prototype and show that it incurs a CAN message latency of less than 4 ms, while giving strong guarantees against non-authentic messages.},

abstract = {Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model requiring prior physical access has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.},

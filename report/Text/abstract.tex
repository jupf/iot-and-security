While IoT devices get more and more widely used, embedded boards are already a
central part of every car for several years now. Sensors and embedded boards for
car control are connected via a multitude of networks. The most widely used of
these networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN), was designed in the eighties
with no security in mind because these networks were closed off. But nowadays
vehicles have a multitude of interfaces to outside networks, so there is a dire
need to modernize the in-vehicle networks with appropriate security measures.
The AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) included security
specifications for CAN authentication a while back. Today there are three
published AUTOSAR-compliant protocols. The most promising called VulCAN provides
real time capable message authentication even if the attacker has fully
compromised their targets.

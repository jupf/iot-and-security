\section{Conclusions}

This report gave a basic introduction about in-vehicle networks and then
detailed the currently published AUTOSAR-compliant message authentication
protocols. The software-only protocols LeiA and vatiCAN secure against attackers
with full access to the CAN network but do not have arbitrary code execution on
all ECUs. They assume that the targeted ECUs are not compromised. The third
published message authentication protocol named VulCAN enhances other protocols
like LeiA and vatiCAN to render arbitrary code execution on every ECU
unperilous. To achieve this VulCAN uses Sancus a trusted execution technology
with low-cost embedded devices. It enables runtime attestation and
authentication of the software components through a hardware-only TCB\@ without
breaking critical real time constraints of the vehicle domain. Additionally
VulCAN provides a way to shield legacy devices without modifying them to help
with the transition towards a secured CAN network.
